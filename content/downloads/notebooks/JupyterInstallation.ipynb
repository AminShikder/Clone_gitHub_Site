    "After proposing some simple solutions that can be used today, I went into a detailed explanation of *why* these solutions are necessary: it comes down to the fact that in Jupyter, the shell and the kernel are entirely disconnected.\n",
    "The fact that a full explanation took so many words and touched so many concepts, I think, indicates a real usability issue for the Jupyter ecosystem.\n",
    "Finally, I proposed a few possible avenues that the community might adopt to try to streamline this process.\n",
    "I hope that these ideas are useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final addendum: I have a huge amount of respect and appreciation for the developers of Jupyter, Conda, Pip, and related tools that form the foundations of the Python data science ecosystem.\n",
    "I'm fairly certain those developers have already considered these issues and weighed some of these potential fixes – if any of you are reading this, please feel free to comment and set me straight on anything I've overlooked!\n",
    "And, finally, thanks for all that you do."
